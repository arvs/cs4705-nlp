19 When WRB the DT price NN of IN plastics NNS took VBD off RP in IN 1987 CD , , Quantum NNP Chemical NNP Corp. NNP went VBD along IN for IN the DT ride NN . .
32 The DT timing NN of IN Quantum NNP 's POS chief JJ executive JJ officer NN , , John NNP Hoyt NNP Stookey NNP , , appeared VBD to TO be VB nothing NN less JJR than IN inspired VBN , , because IN he PRP had VBD just RB increased VBN Quantum NNP 's POS reliance NN on IN plastics NNS . .
17 The DT company NN outpaced VBD much RB of IN the DT chemical NN industry NN as IN annual JJ profit NN grew VBD fivefold RB in IN two CD years NNS . .
22 Mr. NNP Stookey NNP said VBD of IN the DT boom NN , , `` `` It PRP 's VBZ going VBG to TO last VB a DT whole JJ lot NN longer JJR than IN anybody NN thinks VBZ . . '' ''
12 But CC now RB prices NNS have VBP nose-dived VBD and CC Quantum NNP 's POS profit NN is VBZ plummeting VBG . .
41 Some DT securities NNS analysts NNS are VBP looking VBG for IN no DT better JJR than IN break-even JJ results NNS from IN the DT company NN for IN the DT third JJ quarter NN , , compared VBN with IN year-earlier JJ profit NN of IN $ $ 99.8 CD million CD , , or CC $ $ 3.92 CD a DT share NN , , on IN sales NNS of IN $ $ 724.4 CD million CD . .

24 To TO a DT degree NN , , Quantum NNP represents VBZ the DT new JJ times NNS that WDT have VBP arrived VBN for IN producers NNS of IN the DT so-called JJ commodity NN plastics NNS that WDT pervade VBP modern JJ life NN . .
22 Having VBG just RB passed VBN through IN one CD of IN the DT most RBS profitable JJ periods NNS in IN their PRP$ history NN , , these DT producers NNS now RB see VBP their PRP$ prices NNS eroding VBG . .
14 Pricing NN cycles NNS , , to TO be VB sure JJ , , are VBP nothing NN new JJ for IN plastics NNS producers NNS . .
21 And CC the DT financial JJ decline NN of IN some DT looks NNS steep JJ only RB in IN comparison NN with IN the DT heady JJ period NN that WDT is VBZ just RB behind IN them PRP . .

12 `` `` Now RB we PRP 're VBP at IN the DT bottom NN of IN the DT heap NN . . '' ''
23 At IN Quantum NNP , , which WDT is VBZ based VBN in IN New NNP York NNP , , the DT trouble NN is VBZ magnified VBN by IN the DT company NN 's POS heavy JJ dependence NN on IN plastics NNS . .
37 Once RB known VBN as IN National NNP Distillers NNPS & CC Chemical NNP Corp. NNP , , the DT company NN exited VBD the DT wine NN and CC spirits NNS business NN and CC plowed VBN more JJR of IN its PRP$ resources NNS into IN plastics NNS after IN Mr. NNP Stookey NNP took VBD the DT chief JJ executive NN 's POS job NN in IN 1986 CD . .
46 Mr. NNP Stookey NNP , , 59 CD years NNS old JJ , , declined VBD to TO be VB interviewed VBN for IN this DT article NN , , but CC he PRP has VBZ consistently RB argued VBN that IN over IN the DT long JJ haul NN -- : across IN both DT the DT peaks NNS and CC the DT troughs NNS of IN the DT plastics NNS market NN -- : Quantum NNP will MD prosper VB through IN its PRP$ new JJ direction NN . .
30 Quantum NNP 's POS lot NN is VBZ mostly RB tied VBN to TO polyethylene NN resin NN , , used VBN to TO make VB garbage NN bags NNS , , milk NN jugs NNS , , housewares NNS , , toys NNS and CC meat NN packaging NN , , among IN other JJ items NNS . .
17 In IN the DT U.S. NNP polyethylene NN market NN , , Quantum NNP has VBZ claimed VBN the DT largest JJS share NN , , about IN 20 CD % NN . .
31 But CC its PRP$ competitors NNS -- : including VBG Dow NNP Chemical NNP Co. NNP , , Union NNP Carbide NNP Corp. NNP and CC several JJ oil NN giants NNS -- : have VBP much RB broader JJR business NN interests NNS and CC so RB are VBP better RB cushioned VBN against IN price NN swings NNS . .
31 When WRB the DT price NN of IN polyethylene NN moves VBZ a DT mere JJ penny NN a DT pound NN , , Quantum NNP 's POS annual JJ profit NN fluctuates NNS by IN about RB 85 CD cents NNS a DT share NN , , provided VBD no DT other JJ variables NNS are VBP changing VBG . .
22 In IN recent JJ months NNS the DT price NN of IN polyethylene NN , , even RB more JJR than IN that IN of IN other JJ commodity NN plastics NNS , , has VBZ taken VBN a DT dive NN . .
27 Benchmark NNP grades NNS , , which WDT still RB sold VBD for IN as RB much JJ as IN 50 CD cents NNS a DT pound NN last JJ spring NN , , have VBP skidded VBD to TO between IN 35 CD cents NNS and CC 40 CD cents NNS . .
21 Meanwhile RB , , the DT price NN of IN ethylene NN , , the DT chemical NN building NN block NN of IN polyethylene NN , , has VBZ n't RB dropped VBN nearly RB so RB fast RB . .
19 That DT discrepancy NN hurts VBZ Quantum NNP badly RB , , because IN its PRP$ own JJ plants NNS cover VBP only JJ about IN half NN of IN its PRP$ ethylene NN needs VBZ . .
22 By IN many JJ accounts NNS , , an DT early JJ hint NN of IN a DT price NN rout NN in IN the DT making VBG came VBD at IN the DT start NN of IN this DT year NN . .
16 China NNP , , which WDT had VBD been VBN putting VBG in IN huge JJ orders NNS for IN polyethylene NN , , abruptly RB halted VBD them PRP . .
33 Calculating VBG that IN excess JJ polyethylene NN would MD soon RB be VB sloshing VBG around IN the DT world NN , , other JJ buyers NNS then RB bet VBD that IN prices NNS had VBD peaked VBN and CC so RB began VBD to TO draw VB down RP inventories NNS rather RB than IN order VB new JJ product NN . .
30 Kenneth NNP Mitchell NNP , , director NN of IN Dow NNP 's POS polyethylene NN business NN , , says VBZ producers NNS were VBD surprised VBN to TO learn VB how WRB much JJ inventories NNS had VBD swelled VBN throughout IN the DT distribution NN chain NN as IN prices NNS spiraled VBD up RP . .
11 `` `` People NNS were VBD even RB hoarding VBG bags NNS , , '' '' he PRP says VBZ . .

19 They PRP recently RB announced VBD increases NNS of IN a DT few JJ cents NNS a DT pound NN to TO take VB effect NN in IN the DT next JJ several JJ weeks NNS . .
21 No DT one CD knows VBZ , , however RB , , whether IN the DT new JJ posted VBD prices NNS will MD stick VB once RB producers NNS and CC customers NNS start VBP to TO haggle VB . .
20 One CD doubter NN is VBZ George NNP Krug NNP , , a DT chemical-industry NN analyst NN at IN Oppenheimer NNP & CC Co. NNP and CC a DT bear NN on IN plastics NNS stocks NNS . .
20 Noting VBG others NNS ' POS estimates NNS of IN when WRB price NN increases NNS can MD be VB sustained VBN , , he PRP remarks VBZ , , `` `` Some DT say VBP October NNP . .

20 He PRP argues VBZ that IN efforts NNS to TO firm VB up IN prices NNS will MD be VB undermined VBN by IN producers NNS ' POS plans NNS to TO expand VB production NN capacity NN . .
14 A DT quick JJ turnaround NN is VBZ crucial JJ to TO Quantum NNP because IN its PRP$ cash NN requirements NNS remain VBP heavy JJ . .
19 The DT company NN is VBZ trying VBG to TO carry VB out RP a DT three-year JJ , , $ $ 1.3 CD billion CD plant-expansion NN program NN started VBD this DT year NN . .
42 At IN the DT same JJ time NN , , its PRP$ annual JJ payments NNS on IN long-term JJ debt NN will MD more RBR than IN double JJ from IN a DT year NN ago RB to TO about RB $ $ 240 CD million CD , , largely RB because IN of IN debt NN taken VBN on IN to TO pay VB a DT $ $ 50-a-share JJ special JJ dividend NN earlier RBR this DT year NN . .
32 Quantum NNP described VBD the DT payout NN at IN the DT time NN as IN a DT way NN for IN it PRP to TO share VB the DT bonanza NN with IN its PRP$ holders NNS , , because IN its PRP$ stock NN price NN was VBD n't RB reflecting VBG the DT huge JJ profit NN increases NNS . .
14 Some DT analysts NNS saw VBD the DT payment NN as IN an DT effort NN also RB to TO dispel VB takeover NN speculation NN . .
52 Whether IN a DT cash NN crunch NN might MD eventually RB force VB the DT company NN to TO cut VB its PRP$ quarterly JJ dividend NN , , raised VBD 36 CD % NN to TO 75 CD cents NNS a DT share NN only RB a DT year NN ago RB , , has VBZ become VBN a DT topic NN of IN intense JJ speculation NN on IN Wall NNP Street NNP since IN Mr. NNP Stookey NNP deflected VBD dividend NN questions NNS in IN a DT Sept.

23 Some DT viewed VBD his PRP$ response NN -- : that DT company NN directors NNS review VBP the DT dividend NN regularly RB -- : as IN nothing NN more RBR than IN the DT standard JJ line NN from IN executives NNS . .
16 But CC others NNS came VBD away RB thinking VBG he PRP had VBD given VBN something NN less JJR than IN his PRP$ usual JJ straight-from-the-shoulder JJ performance NN . .
25 In IN any DT case NN , , on IN the DT day NN of IN the DT meeting NN , , Quantum NNP 's POS shares NNS slid VBD $ $ 2.625 CD to TO $ $ 36.625 CD in IN Big NNP Board NNP trading NN . .
18 On IN top NN of IN everything NN else RB , , Quantum NNP confronts VBZ a DT disaster NN at IN its PRP$ plant NN in IN Morris NNP , , Ill NNP . .
27 After IN an DT explosion NN idled VBD the DT plant NN in IN June NNP , , the DT company NN progressed VBD in IN September NNP to TO within IN 12 CD hours NNS of IN completing VBG the DT drawn-out JJ process NN of IN restarting VBG it PRP . .
6 Then RB a DT second JJ explosion NN occurred VBD . .
10 Two CD workers NNS died VBD and CC six CD remain VBP in IN the DT hospital NN . .
18 This DT human JJ toll NN adds VBZ the DT most RBS painful JJ dimension NN yet RB to TO the DT sudden JJ change NN in IN Quantum NNP 's POS fortunes NNS . .
20 Until IN this DT year NN , , the DT company NN had VBD been VBN steadily RB lowering VBG its PRP$ accident NN rate NN and CC picking VBG up RP trade-group NN safety NN awards NNS . .
17 A DT prolonged VBN production NN halt NN at IN the DT plant NN could MD introduce VB another DT imponderable JJ into IN Quantum NNP 's POS financial JJ future NN . .
25 When WRB a DT plant NN has VBZ just RB been VBN running VBG flat JJ out IN to TO meet VB demand NN , , calculating VBG lost VBN profit NN and CC thus RB claims NNS under IN business-interruption NN insurance NN is VBZ straightforward JJ . .
20 But CC the DT numbers NNS become VBP trickier JJR -- : and CC subject JJ to TO dickering VBG between IN insured JJ and CC insurer NN -- : when WRB demand NN is VBZ shifting VBG . .
43 `` `` You PRP say VBP you PRP could MD have VB sold VBN X NNP percent NN of IN this DT product NN and CC Y NNP percent NN of IN that WDT , , '' '' recalls VBZ Theodore NNP Semegran NNP , , an DT analyst NN at IN Shearson NNP Lehman NNP Hutton NNP who WP went VBD through IN this DT exercise NN during IN his PRP$ former JJ career NN as IN a DT chemical NN engineer NN . .
10 `` `` And CC then RB you PRP still RB have VBP to TO negotiate VB . . '' ''
24 Quantum NNP hopes VBZ the DT Morris NNP plant NN , , where WRB limited JJ production NN got VBD under IN way NN last JJ week NN , , will MD resume VB full JJ operation NN by IN year NN 's POS end NN . .
23 The DT plant NN usually RB accounts VBZ for IN 20 CD % NN to TO 25 CD % NN of IN Quantum NNP 's POS polyethylene NN production NN and CC 50 CD % NN of IN its PRP$ ethylene NN production NN . .
7 Not RB everything NN looks VBZ grim JJ for IN Quantum NNP . .
24 The DT plant NN expansion NN should MD strengthen VB the DT company NN 's POS sway VB in IN the DT polyethylene NN business NN , , where WRB market NN share NN is VBZ often RB taken VBN through IN sheer JJ capacity NN . .
17 By IN lifting VBG ethylene NN production NN , , the DT expansion NN will MD also RB lower VB the DT company NN 's POS raw JJ material NN costs NNS . .
17 Quantum NNP is VBZ also RB tightening VBG its PRP$ grip NN on IN its PRP$ one CD large JJ business NN outside IN chemicals NNS , , propane NN marketing NN . .

16 The DT company NN introduced VBD a DT superconcentrated JJ Lemon NNP Cheer NNP in IN Japan NNP after IN watching VBG the DT success NN of IN Attack NNP . .

18 With IN the DT help NN of IN Lemon NNP Cheer NNP , , P&G NNP 's POS share NN is VBZ now RB estimated VBN to TO be VB 12 CD % NN . .
42 While IN the DT Japanese JJ have VBP embraced VBN the DT compact JJ packaging NN and CC convenience NN of IN concentrated JJ products NNS , , the DT true JJ test NN for IN P&G NNP will MD be VB in IN the DT $ $ 4 CD billion CD U.S. NNP detergent NN market NN , , where WRB growth NN is VBZ slow JJ and CC liquids NNS have VBP gained VBN prominence NN over IN powders NNS . .
37 The DT company NN may MD have VB chosen VBN to TO market VB the DT product NN under IN the DT Cheer NNP name NN since IN it PRP 's VBZ already RB expanded VBN its PRP$ best-selling JJ Tide NNP into IN 16 CD different JJ varieties NNS , , including VBG this DT year NN 's POS big JJ hit NN , , Tide NNP with IN Bleach NNP . .
45 With IN superconcentrates NNS , , however RB , , it PRP is VBZ n't RB always RB easy JJ to TO persuade VB consumers NNS that IN less JJR is VBZ more RBR ; : many JJ people NNS tend VBP to TO dump VB too RB much JJ detergent NN into IN the DT washing VBG machine NN , , believing VBG that IN it PRP takes VBZ a DT cup NN of IN powder NN to TO really RB clean VB the DT laundry NN . .
24 In IN the DT early JJ 1980s CD , , P&G NNP tried VBD to TO launch VB here RB a DT concentrated JJ detergent NN under IN the DT Ariel NNP brand NN name NN that IN it PRP markets NNS in IN Europe NNP . .

21 But CC P&G NNP contends VBZ the DT new JJ Cheer NNP is VBZ a DT unique JJ formula NN that WDT also RB offers VBZ an DT ingredient NN that WDT prevents VBZ colors NNS from IN fading JJ . .
20 And CC retailers NNS are VBP expected VBN to TO embrace VB the DT product NN , , in IN part NN because IN it PRP will MD take VB up RB less JJR shelf NN space NN . .
22 `` `` When WRB shelf NN space NN was VBD cheap JJ , , bigger JJR was VBD better RBR , , '' '' says VBZ Hugh NNP Zurkuhlen NNP , , an DT analyst NN at IN Salomon NNP Bros NNP . .
16 But CC with IN so RB many JJ brands NNS vying VBG for IN space NN , , that WDT 's VBZ no RB longer RB the DT case NN . .
24 If IN the DT new JJ Cheer NNP sells VBZ well RB , , the DT trend NN toward IN smaller JJR packaging NN is VBZ likely JJ to TO accelerate VB as IN competitors NNS follow VBP with IN their PRP$ own JJ superconcentrates NNS . .
18 Then RB retailers NNS `` `` will MD probably RB push VB the DT -LCB- JJ less-established JJ -RCB- JJ brands NNS out IN altogether RB , , '' '' he PRP says VBZ . .
17 Competition NN is VBZ bound VBN to TO get VB tougher JJR if IN Kao NNP introduces VBZ a DT product NN like IN Attack NNP in IN the DT U.S. NNP . .
30 To TO be VB sure JJ , , Kao NNP would MD n't RB have VB an DT easy JJ time NN taking VBG U.S. NNP market NN share NN away RB from IN the DT mighty JJ P&G NNP , , which WDT has VBZ about IN 23 CD % NN of IN the DT market NN . .
41 Kao NNP officials NNS previously RB have VBP said VBN they PRP are VBP interested JJ in IN selling VBG detergents NNS in IN the DT U.S. NNP , , but CC so RB far RB the DT company NN has VBZ focused VBN on IN acquisitions NNS , , such JJ as IN last JJ year NN 's POS purchase NN of IN Andrew NNP Jergens NNP Co.

9 It PRP also RB has VBZ a DT product-testing JJ facility NN in IN California NNP . .
17 Some DT believe VBP P&G NNP 's POS interest NN in IN a DT superconcentrated VBN detergent NN goes VBZ beyond IN the DT concern NN for IN the DT Japanese JJ . .
17 `` `` This DT is VBZ something NN P&G NNP would MD do VB with IN or CC without IN Kao NNP , , '' '' says VBZ Mr. NNP Zurkuhlen NNP . .
25 With IN economic JJ tension NN between IN the DT U.S. NNP and CC Japan NNP worsening VBG , , many JJ Japanese JJ had VBD feared VBN last JJ week NN 's POS visit NN from IN U.S. NNP Trade NNP Representative NNP Carla NNP Hills NNP . .
21 They PRP expected VBD a DT new JJ barrage NN of IN demands NNS that IN Japan NNP do VBP something NN quickly RB to TO reduce VB its PRP$ trade NN surplus NN with IN the DT U.S. NNP . .
26 Instead RB , , they PRP got VBD a DT discussion NN of IN the DT need NN for IN the DT U.S. NNP and CC Japan NNP to TO work VB together RB and CC of IN the DT importance NN of IN the DT long-term JJ view NN . .
30 Mrs. NNP Hills NNP ' POS first JJ trip NN to TO Japan NNP as IN America NNP 's POS chief JJ trade NN negotiator NN had VBD a DT completely RB different JJ tone NN from IN last JJ month NN 's POS visit NN by IN Commerce NNP Secretary NNP Robert NNP A. NNP Mosbacher NNP . .

22 He PRP said VBD such JJ results NNS should MD be VB `` `` measurable JJ in IN dollars NNS and CC cents NNS '' '' in IN reducing VBG the DT U.S. NNP trade NN deficit NN with IN Japan NNP . .
47 But CC Mrs. NNP Hills NNP , , speaking NN at IN a DT breakfast NN meeting NN of IN the DT American JJ Chamber NNP of IN Commerce NNP in IN Japan NNP on IN Saturday NNP , , stressed VBD that IN the DT objective NN `` `` is VBZ not RB to TO get VB definitive JJ action NN by IN spring NN or CC summer NN , , it PRP is VBZ rather RB to TO have VB a DT blueprint NN for IN action NN . .

33 She PRP added VBD that IN she PRP expected VBD `` `` perhaps RB to TO have VB a DT down JJ payment NN ... : some DT small JJ step NN to TO convince VB the DT American JJ people NNS and CC the DT Japanese JJ people NNS that IN we PRP 're VBP moving VBG in IN earnest JJ . . '' ''
13 How WRB such JJ remarks NNS translate VB into IN policy NN wo MD n't RB become VB clear JJ for IN months NNS . .
19 American JJ and CC Japanese JJ officials NNS offered VBD several JJ theories NNS for IN the DT difference NN in IN approach NN betwen NN Mr. NNP Mosbacher NNP and CC Mrs. NNP Hills NNP . .

29 Yet RB more RBR than IN one CD American JJ official NN who WP sat VBD in IN with IN her PRP$ during IN three CD days NNS of IN talks NNS with IN Japanese JJ officials NNS said VBD her PRP$ tone NN often RB was VBD surprisingly RB `` `` conciliatory JJ . . '' ''

11 `` `` That DT perception NN takes VBZ the DT focus NN off IN the DT magazine NN . . '' ''
20 Time NNP magazine NN executives NNS predictably RB paint VBP the DT circulation NN cut VBD as IN a DT show NN of IN strength NN and CC actually RB a DT benefit NN to TO advertisers NNS . .

40 Mr. NNP Heinemann NNP said VBD the DT changes NNS represent VBP a DT new JJ focus NN in IN the DT magazine NN industry NN : : a DT magazine NN 's POS net JJ revenue NN per IN subscriber NN , , or CC the DT actual JJ revenue NN from IN subscribers NNS after IN discounts NNS and CC the DT cost NN of IN premiums NNS have VBP been VBN stripped VBN away RB . .
18 `` `` The DT question NN is VBZ how WRB much JJ are VBP we PRP getting VBG from IN each DT reader NN , , '' '' said VBD Mr. NNP Heinemann NNP . .

18 Both DT magazines NNS are VBP expected VBN to TO announce VB their PRP$ ad NN rates NNS and CC circulation NN levels NNS for IN 1990 CD within IN a DT month NN . .
25 When WRB the DT news NN broke VBD of IN an DT attempted VBN coup NN in IN Panama NNP two CD weeks NNS ago RB , , Sen. NNP Christopher NNP Dodd NNP called VBD the DT State NNP Department NNP for IN a DT briefing NN . .
14 `` `` They PRP said VBD , , ` `` follow VB CNN NNP , , ' '' '' '' he PRP told VBD reporters NNS . .
29 That DT shows VBZ how WRB far RB Ted NNP Turner NNP 's POS Cable NNP News NNP Network NNP has VBZ come VBN since IN its PRP$ birth NN nine CD years NNS ago RB , , when WRB it PRP was VBD considered VBN the DT laughingstock NN of IN television NN news NN . .

19 Its PRP$ niche NN as IN the DT `` `` network NN of IN record NN '' '' during IN major JJ crises NNS draws VBZ elite NN audiences NNS around IN the DT world NN . .

35 Tonight NNP , , to TO kick VB off RP the DT effort NN , , CNN NNP will MD premiere VB its PRP$ first JJ prime-time JJ newscast NN in IN years NNS , , an DT hourlong JJ show NN at IN 6 CD p.m RB . . Eastern JJ time NN to TO air VB head-to-head NN against IN the DT network NN newscasts NNS . .

38 The DT new JJ show NN is VBZ perhaps RB the DT boldest JJS in IN a DT number NN of IN steps NNS the DT network NN is VBZ taking VBG to TO build VB audience NN loyalty NN by IN shifting VBG away RB from IN its PRP$ current JJ format NN toward IN more RBR full-length JJ `` `` signature NN '' '' programming NN with IN recognizable JJ stars NNS . .
17 To TO distinguish VB itself PRP , , CNN NNP is VBZ also RB expanding VBG international JJ coverage NN and CC adding VBG a DT second JJ global-news JJ program NN . .

14 He PRP said VBD the DT thrift NN will MD try VB to TO get VB regulators NNS to TO reverse VB the DT decision NN . .
24 The DT suspension NN of IN a DT preferred JJ stock NN dividend NN is VBZ a DT serious JJ step NN that WDT signals VBZ that IN regulators NNS have VBP deep JJ concerns NNS about IN an DT institution NN 's POS health NN . .
24 In IN March NNP , , regulators NNS labeled VBD CenTrust NNP a DT `` `` troubled JJ institution NN , , '' '' largely RB because IN of IN its PRP$ big JJ junk-bond NN holdings NNS and CC its PRP$ operating NN losses NNS . .

16 CenTrust NNP and CC regulators NNS have VBP been VBN in IN a DT dispute NN over IN market NN valuations NNS for IN the DT junk NN bonds NNS . .

18 The DT legislation NN requires VBZ thrifts NNS to TO divest VB themselves PRP of IN junk NN bonds NNS in IN the DT new JJ , , somber JJ regulatory JJ climate NN . .
20 In IN American NNP Stock NNP Exchange NNP composite JJ trading NN Friday NNP , , CenTrust NNP common JJ shares NNS closed VBD at IN $ $ 3 CD , , down RB 12.5 CD cents NNS . .
40 In IN a DT statement NN Friday NNP , , Mr. NNP Paul NNP challenged VBD the DT regulators NNS ' POS decision NN , , saying VBG the DT thrift NN 's POS operating NN losses NNS and CC `` `` apparent JJ '' '' junk-bond NN losses NNS `` `` have VBP been VBN substantially RB offset VBN by IN gains NNS in IN other JJ activities NNS of IN the DT bank NN . . '' ''
17 He PRP also RB said VBD substantial JJ reserves NNS have VBP been VBN set VBN aside RB for IN possible JJ losses NNS from IN the DT junk NN bonds NNS . .
18 In IN the DT third JJ quarter NN , , for IN instance NN , , CenTrust NNP added VBD $ $ 22.5 CD million CD to TO its PRP$ general JJ reserves NNS . .

35 The DT branch NN sale NN is VBZ the DT centerpiece NN of IN CenTrust NNP 's POS strategy NN to TO transform VB itself PRP into IN a DT traditional JJ S&L NN from IN a DT high-flying JJ institution NN that WDT relied VBD heavily RB on IN securities NNS trading NN for IN profits NNS , , according VBG to TO Mr. NNP Paul NNP . .
24 Most JJS analysts NNS and CC thrift NN executives NNS had VBD expected VBN a DT decision NN on IN the DT proposed VBN transaction NN , , which WDT was VBD announced VBN in IN July NNP , , long RB before IN now RB . .
15 Many JJ interpret VB the DT delay NN as IN an DT indication NN that IN regulators NNS are VBP skeptical JJ about IN the DT proposal NN . .
19 Branches NNS and CC deposits NNS can MD be VB sold VBN at IN a DT premium NN in IN the DT event NN federal JJ regulators NNS take VBP over RP an DT institution NN . .
32 CenTrust NNP , , however RB , , touts VBZ the DT branch NN sale NN , , saying VBG it PRP would MD bring VB in IN $ $ 150 CD million CD and CC reduce VB the DT thrift NN 's POS assets NNS to TO $ $ 6.7 CD billion CD from IN $ $ 9 CD billion CD . .
41 It PRP said VBD the DT sale NN would MD give VB it PRP positive JJ tangible JJ capital NN of IN $ $ 82 CD million CD , , or CC about IN 1.2 CD % NN of IN assets NNS , , from IN a DT negative JJ $ $ 33 CD million CD as IN of IN Sept.

22 CenTrust NNP said VBD the DT branch NN sale NN would MD also RB reduce VB the DT company NN 's POS large JJ amount NN of IN good JJ will MD by IN about RB $ $ 180 CD million CD . .
22 Critics NNS , , however RB , , say VBP the DT branch NN sale NN will MD make VB CenTrust NNP more RBR dependent JJ than IN ever RB on IN brokered VBN deposits NNS and CC junk NN bonds NNS . .
31 Mr. NNP Paul NNP counters NNS that WDT he PRP intends VBZ to TO further RBR pare VB the DT size NN of IN CenTrust NNP by IN not RB renewing VBG more JJR than IN $ $ 1 CD billion CD of IN brokered VBN certificates NNS of IN deposit NN when WRB they PRP come VBP due JJ . .
40 The DT thrift NN is VBZ also RB working VBG to TO unload VB its PRP$ junk-bond NN portfolio NN by IN continuing VBG to TO sell VB off RP the DT bonds NNS , , and CC it PRP plans VBZ to TO eventually RB place VB some DT of IN them PRP in IN a DT separate JJ affiliate NN , , as IN required VBN under IN the DT new JJ thrift NN law NN . .

23 But CC much RB of IN what WP the DT Europeans NNPS want VBP to TO protect VB seems VBZ every DT bit NN as IN cheesy NN as IN what WP they PRP are VBP trying VBG to TO keep VB out RP . .
37 The DT most RBS militant JJ opposition NN to TO American JJ TV NN imports NNS has VBZ come VBN from IN French JJ television NN and CC movie NN producers NNS , , who WP have VBP demanded VBN quotas NNS ensuring VBG that IN a DT full JJ 60 CD % NN of IN Europe NNP 's POS TV NN shows NNS be VB produced VBN in IN Europe NNP . .
15 So RB far RB , , the DT French NNP have VBP failed VBN to TO win VB enough JJ broad-based JJ support NN to TO prevail VB . .

29 If IN this DT seems VBZ like IN pretty JJ weak JJ stuff NN around IN which WDT to TO raise VB the DT protectionist NN barriers NNS , , it PRP may MD be VB because IN these DT shows NNS need VBP all PDT the DT protection NN they PRP can MD get VB . .
19 European JJ programs NNS usually RB target VBP only RB their PRP$ own JJ local JJ audience NN , , and CC often RB only RB a DT small JJ portion NN of IN that WDT . .

20 But CC it PRP may MD be VB weeks NNS before IN GEC NNP and CC its PRP$ potential JJ partners NNS decide VBP whether IN to TO bid VB , , the DT source NN indicated VBD . .

45 Also RB , , any DT GEC NNP bid NN might MD be VB blocked VBN by IN British JJ antitrust JJ regulators NNS ; : Ferranti NNP is VBZ GEC NNP 's POS main JJ competitor NN on IN several JJ key JJ defense-electronics NNS contracts NNS , , and CC its PRP$ purchase NN by IN GEC NNP may MD heighten VB British NNP Defense NNP Ministry NNP worries VBZ about IN concentration NN in IN the DT country NN 's POS defense NN industry NN . .
21 A DT consortium NN bid NN , , however RB , , would MD diminish VB GEC NNP 's POS direct JJ role NN in IN Ferranti NNP and CC might MD consequently RB appease VB ministry NN officials NNS . .
30 A DT British JJ Aerospace NNP spokeswoman NN appeared VBD unperturbed JJ by IN the DT prospect NN of IN a DT fight NN with IN GEC NNP for IN Ferranti NNP : : `` `` Competition NN is VBZ the DT name NN of IN the DT game NN , , '' '' she PRP said VBD . .
17 At IN least JJS one CD potential JJ GEC NNP partner NN , , Matra NNP , , insists VBZ it PRP is VBZ n't RB interested JJ in IN Ferranti NNP . .
23 `` `` We PRP have VBP nothing NN to TO say VB about IN this DT affair NN , , which WDT does VBZ n't RB concern VB us PRP , , '' '' a DT Matra NNP official NN said VBD Sunday NNP . .
24 The DT missile NN venture NN , , the DT British JJ Aerospace NNP spokeswoman NN said VBD , , is VBZ a DT needed VBN response NN to TO the DT `` `` new JJ environment NN '' '' in IN defense NN contracting NN . .
47 For IN both DT Thomson NNP and CC British JJ Aerospace NNP , , earnings NNS in IN their PRP$ home NN markets NNS have VBP come VBN under IN pressure NN from IN increasingly RB tight-fisted JJ defense NN ministries NNS ; : and CC Middle NNP East NNP sales NNS , , a DT traditional JJ mainstay NN for IN both DT companies NNS ' POS exports NNS , , have VBP been VBN hurt VBN by IN five CD years NNS of IN weak JJ oil NN prices NNS . .
9 The DT venture NN 's POS importance NN for IN Thomson NNP is VBZ great JJ . .
16 Thomson NNP feels VBZ the DT future NN of IN its PRP$ defense NN business NN depends VBZ on IN building VBG cooperation NN with IN other JJ Europeans NNPS . .
38 The DT European JJ defense NN industry NN is VBZ consolidating VBG ; : for IN instance NN , , West NNP Germany NNP 's POS Siemens NNP AG NNP recently RB joined VBD GEC NNP in IN a DT takeover NN of IN Britain NNP 's POS Plessey NNP Co.

34 In IN missiles NNS , , Thomson NNP is VBZ already RB overshadowed VBN by IN British JJ Aerospace NNP and CC by IN its PRP$ home NN rival NN , , France NNP 's POS Aerospatiale NNP S.A.

19 To TO justify VB 50-50 JJ ownership NN of IN the DT planned JJ venture NN , , Thomson NNP would MD make VB a DT cash NN payment NN to TO British JJ Aerospace NNP . .
19 Annual JJ revenue NN of IN British JJ Aerospace NNP 's POS missile NN business NN is VBZ about IN # # 950 CD million CD , , a DT Thomson NNP spokesman NN said VBD . .
15 British JJ Aerospace NNP 's POS chief JJ missile NN products NNS include VBP its PRP$ 17-year-old JJ family NN of IN Rapier NNP surface-to-air NN missiles NNS . .
20 Thomson NNP missile NN products NNS , , with IN about RB half DT British JJ Aerospace NNP 's POS annual JJ revenue NN , , include VBP the DT Crotale NNP surface-to-air NN missile NN family NN . .
34 Interprovincial NNP Pipe NNP Line NNP Co.

46 Interprovincial NNP , , Canada NNP 's POS biggest JJS oil NN pipeline NN operator NN and CC a DT major JJ transporter NN of IN crude NN to TO the DT U.S. NNP , , said VBD revised JJ industry NN forecasts NNS indicate VBP that IN Canadian JJ oil NN output NN will MD total VB about IN 1.64 CD million CD barrels NNS a DT day NN by IN 1991 CD , , 8 CD % NN lower JJR than IN a DT previous JJ estimate NN . .
24 Canadian JJ crude NN production NN averaged VBD about IN 1.69 CD million CD barrels NNS a DT day NN during IN 1989 CD 's POS first JJ half NN , , about IN 1 CD % NN below IN the DT 1988 CD level NN . .
52 `` `` The DT capability NN of IN existing VBG fields NNS to TO deliver VB oil NN is VBZ dropping VBG , , '' '' and CC oil NN exploration NN activity NN is VBZ also RB down RB dramatically RB , , as IN many JJ producers NNS shift VBP their PRP$ emphasis NN to TO natural JJ gas NN , , said VBD Ronald NNP Watkins NNP , , vice NN president NN for IN government NN and CC industry NN relations NNS with IN Interprovincial NNP 's POS parent NN , , Interhome NNP Energy NNP Inc NNP . .
30 Mr. NNP Watkins NNP said VBD volume NN on IN Interprovincial NNP 's POS system NN is VBZ down RB about IN 2 CD % NN since IN January NNP and CC is VBZ expected VBN to TO fall VB further RB , , making VBG expansion NN unnecessary JJ until IN perhaps RB the DT mid-1990s NNS . .
19 `` `` There EX has VBZ been VBN a DT swing NN of IN the DT pendulum NN back RB to TO the DT gas NN side NN , , '' '' he PRP said VBD . .
32 Many JJ of IN Canada NNP 's POS oil NN and CC gas NN producers NNS say VBP the DT outlook NN for IN natural JJ gas NN is VBZ better JJR than IN it PRP is VBZ for IN oil NN , , and CC have VBP shifted VBN their PRP$ exploration NN and CC development NN budgets NNS accordingly RB . .
62 The DT number NN of IN active JJ drilling NN rigs NNS in IN Canada NNP is VBZ down RB 30 CD % NN from IN a DT year NN ago RB , , and CC the DT number NN of IN completed VBN oil NN wells NNS is VBZ `` `` down RB more JJR than IN that IN , , due JJ to TO the DT increasing VBG focus NN on IN gas NN exploration NN , , '' '' said VBD Robert NNP Feick NNP , , manager NN of IN crude NN oil NN with IN Calgary NNP 's POS Independent NNP Petroleum NNP Association NNP of IN Canada NNP , , an DT industry NN group NN . .
25 Mr. NNP Watkins NNP said VBD the DT main JJ reason NN for IN the DT production NN decline NN is VBZ shrinking VBG output NN of IN light JJ crude NN from IN mature JJ , , conventional JJ fields NNS in IN western JJ Canada NNP . .
27 Interprovincial NNP transports VBZ about IN 75 CD % NN of IN all DT crude NN produced VBN in IN western JJ Canada NNP , , and CC almost RB 60 CD % NN of IN Interprovincial NNP 's POS total JJ volume NN consists VBZ of IN light JJ crude NN . .
46 Nearly RB all DT of IN the DT crude JJ oil NN that IN Canada NNP exports NNS to TO the DT U.S. NNP is VBZ transported VBN on IN Interprovincial NNP 's POS system NN , , whose WP$ main JJ line NN runs VBZ from IN Edmonton NNP to TO major JJ U.S. NNP and CC Canadian JJ cities NNS in IN the DT Great NNP Lakes NNP region NN , , including VBG Chicago NNP , , Buffalo NNP , , Toronto NNP and CC Montreal NNP . .
39 Canada NNP 's POS current JJ oil NN exports NNS to TO the DT U.S. NNP total JJ about IN 600,000 CD barrels NNS a DT day NN , , or CC about IN 9.1 CD % NN of IN net JJ U.S. NNP crude JJ imports NNS , , said VBD John NNP Lichtblau NNP , , president NN of IN the DT New NNP York-based JJ Petroleum NNP Industry NNP Research NNP Foundation NNP . .
19 That DT ranks VBZ Canada NNP as IN the DT fourth-largest JJ source NN of IN imported VBN crude NN , , behind IN Saudi NNP Arabia NNP , , Nigeria NNP and CC Mexico NNP . .
33 Mr. NNP Lichtblau NNP said VBD Canada NNP 's POS declining VBG crude JJ output NN , , combined VBN with IN the DT fast-shrinking JJ output NN of IN U.S. NNP crude NN , , will MD help VB intensify VB U.S. NNP reliance NN on IN oil NN from IN overseas RB , , particularly RB the DT Middle NNP East NNP . .
9 `` `` It PRP 's VBZ very RB much RB a DT growing VBG concern NN . .
17 But CC when WRB something NN is VBZ inevitable JJ , , you PRP learn VBP to TO live VB with IN it PRP , , '' '' he PRP said VBD . .
38 Mr. NNP Lichtblau NNP stressed VBD that IN the DT delay NN of IN Interprovincial NNP 's POS proposed JJ expansion NN wo MD n't RB by IN itself PRP increase VB U.S. NNP dependence NN on IN offshore JJ crude NN , , however RB , , since IN Canadian JJ imports NNS are VBP limited VBN in IN any DT case NN by IN Canada NNP 's POS falling VBG output NN . .
38 Under IN terms NNS of IN its PRP$ proposed VBN two-step JJ expansion NN , , which WDT would MD have VB required VBN regulatory JJ approval NN , , Interprovincial NNP intended VBD to TO add VB 200,000 CD barrels NNS a DT day NN of IN additional JJ capacity NN to TO its PRP$ system NN , , beginning VBG with IN a DT modest JJ expansion NN by IN 1991 CD . .
13 The DT system NN currently RB has VBZ a DT capacity NN of IN 1.55 CD million CD barrels NNS a DT day NN . .
30 Inland NNP Steel NNP Industries NNP Inc. NNP expects VBZ to TO report VB that IN third-quarter JJ earnings NNS dropped VBD more JJR than IN 50 CD % NN from IN the DT previous JJ quarter NN as IN a DT result NN of IN reduced JJ sales NNS volume NN and CC increased VBD costs NNS . .
43 In IN the DT second JJ quarter NN , , the DT steelmaker NN had VBD net JJ income NN of IN $ $ 45.3 CD million CD or CC $ $ 1.25 CD a DT share NN , , including VBG a DT pretax JJ charge NN of IN $ $ 17 CD million CD related VBN to TO the DT settlement NN of IN a DT suit NN , , on IN sales NNS of IN $ $ 1.11 CD billion CD . .
30 The DT company NN said VBD normal JJ seasonal JJ softness NN and CC lost VBD orders NNS caused VBN by IN prolonged JJ labor NN talks NNS reduced VBD shipments NNS by IN 200,000 CD tons NNS in IN the DT latest JJS quarter NN , , compared VBN with IN the DT second JJ quarter NN . .
33 At IN the DT same JJ time NN , , the DT integrated-steel JJ business NN was VBD hurt VBN by IN continued JJ increases NNS in IN materials NNS costs NNS and CC repair VB and CC maintenance NN expenses NNS , , as RB well RB as IN higher JJR labor NN costs NNS under IN its PRP$ new JJ contract NN . .
21 The DT service-center NN business NN was VBD hurt VBN by IN reduced JJ margins NNS and CC start-up JJ costs NNS associated VBN with IN its PRP$ Joseph NNP T. NNP Ryerson NNP & CC Son NNP unit NN . .
30 The DT company NN said VBD it PRP is VBZ beginning VBG to TO see VB some DT shipping-rate JJ improvements NNS in IN both PDT the DT intergrated-steel JJ and CC steel-service-center JJ segments NNS , , which WDT should MD result VB in IN improved JJ results NNS for IN the DT fourth JJ quarter NN . .

14 Predicting VBG the DT financial JJ results NNS of IN computer NN firms NNS has VBZ been VBN a DT tough JJ job NN lately RB . .
18 Take VB Microsoft NNP Corp. NNP , , the DT largest JJS maker NN of IN personal JJ computer NN software NN and CC generally RB considered VBN an DT industry NN bellwether NN . .
40 In IN July NNP , , the DT company NN stunned VBD Wall NNP Street NNP with IN the DT prediction NN that IN growth NN in IN the DT personal JJ computer NN business NN overall RB would MD be VB only RB 10 CD % NN in IN 1990 CD , , a DT modest JJ increase NN when WRB compared VBN with IN the DT sizzling VBG expansion NN of IN years NNS past JJ . .
41 Investors NNS -- : taking VBG this DT as IN a DT sign NN that IN a DT broad JJ industry NN slump NN was VBD in IN the DT offing NN -- : reacted VBN by IN selling VBG the DT company NN 's POS stock NN , , which WDT lost VBD $ $ 3.25 CD that IN day NN to TO close VB at IN $ $ 52 CD in IN national JJ over-the-counter JJ trading NN . .

20 Last JJ week NN , , Microsoft NNP said VBD it PRP expects VBZ revenue NN for IN its PRP$ first JJ quarter NN ended VBN Sept. NNP 30 CD to TO increase VB 34 CD % NN . .
19 The DT announcement NN caused VBD the DT company NN 's POS stock NN to TO surge VB $ $ 6.50 CD to TO close VB at IN $ $ 75.50 CD a DT share NN . .
24 Microsoft NNP 's POS surprising JJ strength NN is VBZ one CD example NN of IN the DT difficulty NN facing VBG investors NNS looking VBG for IN reassurances NNS about IN the DT financial JJ health NN of IN the DT computer NN firms NNS . .
26 `` `` It PRP 's VBZ hard JJ to TO know VB what WP to TO expect VB at IN this DT point NN , , '' '' said VBD Peter NNP Rogers NNP , , an DT analyst NN at IN Robertson NNP Stephens NNP & CC Co NNP . .

12 Another DT contradictory NN message NN comes VBZ from IN Businessland NNP Inc. NNP , , a DT computer NN retailer NN . .

9 Aldus NNP officials NNS could MD n't RB be VB reached VBN for IN comment NN . .
17 On IN the DT other JJ hand NN , , the DT battle NN of IN the DT bus NN is VBZ expected VBN to TO grow VB increasingly RB irrelevant JJ . .

9 The DT gap NN between IN winners NNS and CC laggards NNS will MD grow VB . .
19 In IN personal JJ computers NNS , , Apple NNP , , Compaq NNP and CC IBM NNP are VBP expected VBN to TO tighten VB their PRP$ hold NN on IN their PRP$ business NN . .
13 At IN the DT same JJ time NN , , second-tier JJR firms NNS will MD continue VB to TO lose VB ground NN . .
12 Some DT lagging JJ competitors NNS even RB may MD leave VB the DT personal JJ computer NN business NN altogether RB . .

26 Mr. NNP Brown NNP estimates VBZ Wyse NNP , , whose WP$ terminals NNS business NN is VBZ strong JJ , , will MD report VB a DT loss NN of IN 12 CD cents NNS a DT share NN for IN its PRP$ quarter NN ended VBD Sept NNP . .
16 Personal-computer NN makers NNS will MD continue VB to TO eat VB away RB at IN the DT business NN of IN more JJR traditional JJ computer NN firms NNS . .
33 Ever-more NNP powerful JJ desk-top JJ computers NNS , , designed VBN with IN one CD or CC more JJR microprocessors NNS as IN their PRP$ `` `` brains NNS , , '' '' are VBP expected VBN to TO increasingly RB take VB on IN functions NNS carried VBD out RP by IN more RBR expensive JJ minicomputers NNS and CC mainframes NNS . .
20 `` `` The DT guys NNS that WDT make VBP traditional JJ hardware NN are VBP really RB being VBG obsoleted VBN by IN microprocessor-based JJ machines NNS , , '' '' said VBD Mr. NNP Benton NNP . .
27 As IN a DT result NN of IN this DT trend NN , , longtime JJ powerhouses NNS H-P NNP , , IBM NNP and CC Digital NNP Equipment NNP Corp. NNP are VBP scrambling VBG to TO counterattack NN with IN microprocessor-based JJ systems NNS of IN their PRP$ own JJ . .

11 That DT share NN has VBZ remained VBN at IN about IN 24 CD % NN since IN 1970 CD . .
24 What WP has VBZ changed VBN is VBZ that DT more JJR of IN the DT young JJ elderly JJ are VBP living VBG with IN spouses NNS rather RB than IN with IN other JJ relatives NNS , , such JJ as IN children NNS . .

11 Of IN course NN , , Mr. NNP Mason NNP did VBD not RB use VB neutral JJ language NN . .
30 As IN a DT practitioner NN of IN ethnic JJ humor NN from IN the DT old JJ days NNS on IN the DT Borscht NNP Belt NNP , , live JJ television NN and CC the DT nightclub NN circuit NN , , Mr. NNP Mason NNP instinctively RB reached VBD for IN the DT vernacular JJ . .

31 If IN Mr. NNP Mason NNP had VBD used VBN less RBR derogatory JJ language NN to TO articulate VB his PRP$ amateur JJ analysis NN of IN the DT voting VBG behavior NN of IN his PRP$ fellow JJ New NNP Yorkers NNPS , , would MD the DT water NN be VB quite RB so RB hot JJ ? .

24 In IN addition NN , , some DT of IN Mr. NNP Mason NNP 's POS critics NNS have VBP implied VBN that IN his PRP$ type NN of IN ethnic JJ humor NN is VBZ itself PRP a DT form NN of IN racism NN . .
21 For IN example NN , , the DT New NNP York NNP state NN counsel NN for IN the DT NAACP NNP said VBD that IN Mr. NNP Mason NNP is VBZ `` `` like IN a DT dinosaur NN . .
12 People NNS are VBP fast RB leaving VBG the DT place NN where WRB he PRP is VBZ stuck VBN . . '' ''

39 The DT latter NN typically RB is VBZ the DT humor NN of IN the DT underdog NN , , and CC it PRP was VBD perfected VBN by IN both DT blacks NNS and CC Jews NNS on IN the DT minstrel NN and CC vaudeville VB stage NN as IN a DT means NNS of IN mocking VBG their PRP$ white JJ and CC gentile JJ audiences NNS along RB with IN themselves PRP . .
24 In IN the DT hands NNS of IN a DT zealot NN like IN Lenny NNP Bruce NNP , , this DT double-edged JJ blade NN could MD cut VB both PDT the DT self NN and CC the DT audience NN to TO ribbons NNS . .
17 But CC wielded JJ by IN a DT pro FW like IN Jackie NNP Mason NNP , , it PRP is VBZ a DT constructive JJ form NN of IN mischief NN . .

37 Because IN despite IN all PDT the DT media NNS prattle VBP about IN comedy NN and CC politics NNS not RB mixing VBG , , they PRP are VBP similar JJ in IN one CD respect NN : : Both DT can MD serve VB as IN mechanisms NNS for IN easing VBG tensions NNS and CC facilitating VBG the DT co-existence NN of IN groups NNS in IN conflict NN . .
26 That DT 's VBZ why WRB it PRP 's VBZ dangerous JJ to TO have VB well-intentioned JJ thought VBN police NNS , , on IN college NN campuses NNS and CC elsewhere RB , , taboo NN all DT critical JJ mention NN of IN group NN differences NNS . .
34 As IN Elizabeth NNP Kristol NNP wrote VBD in IN the DT New NNP York NNP Times NNP just RB before IN the DT Mason NNP donnybrook NN , , `` `` Perhaps RB intolerance NN would MD not RB boil NN over IN with IN such JJ intensity NN if IN honest JJ differences NNS were VBD allowed VBN to TO simmer VB . . '' ''
40 The DT question NN is VBZ , , if IN group NN conflicts NNS still RB exist VBP -LRB- -LRB- as IN undeniably RB they PRP do VBP -RRB- -RRB- , , and CC if IN Mr. NNP Mason NNP 's POS type NN of IN ethnic JJ humor NN is VBZ passe NN , , then RB what WP other JJ means NNS do VBP we PRP have VB for IN letting VBG off RP steam NN ? .
35 Do VBP n't RB say VB the DT TV NN sitcom NN , , because IN that IN happens VBZ to TO be VB a DT genre NN that WDT , , in IN its PRP$ desperate JJ need NN to TO attract VB everybody NN and CC offend VB nobody NN , , resembles VBZ politics NNS more RBR than IN it PRP does VBZ comedy NN . .
33 It PRP is VBZ true JJ that IN the DT best JJS sitcoms NNS do VBP allow VB group NN differences NNS to TO simmer VB : : yuppies NNS vs. CC blue-collar JJ Bostonians NNPS in IN `` `` Cheers NNP '' '' ; : children NNS vs. IN adults NNS in IN `` `` The DT Cosby NNP Show NNP . . '' ''
10 But CC these DT are VBP not RB the DT differences NNS that WDT make VBP headlines NNS . .
48 In IN `` `` Chicken NNP Soup NNP , , '' '' Mr. NNP Mason NNP plays VBZ Jackie NNP , , a DT Jewish JJ bachelor NN courting VBG Maddie NNP -LRB- -LRB- Lynn NNP Redgrave NNP -RRB- -RRB- , , an DT Irish JJ widow NN and CC mother NN of IN three CD , , against IN the DT wishes NNS of IN his PRP$ mother NN -LRB- -LRB- Rita NNP Karin NNP -RRB- -RRB- and CC her PRP$ brother NN Michael NNP -LRB- -LRB- Brandon NNP Maggart NNP -RRB- -RRB- . .
11 It PRP 's VBZ worth JJ noting VBG that IN both DT disapproving VBG relatives NNS are VBP immigrants NNS . .
16 At IN least JJS , , they PRP both DT speak VBP with IN strong JJ accents NNS , , as RB do VBP Jackie NNP and CC Maddie NNP . .
19 It PRP could MD n't RB be VB more JJR obvious JJ that IN `` `` Chicken NNP Soup NNP '' '' is VBZ being VBG made VBN from IN an DT old JJ recipe NN . .
25 And CC a DT safe JJ one CD -- : imagine VB if IN the DT romance NN in IN question NN were VBD between IN an DT Orthodox NNP Jew NNP and CC a DT member NN of IN the DT Nation NNP of IN Islam NNP . .
56 Back RB in IN the DT 1920s CD , , the DT play NN and CC movie NN versions NNS of IN `` `` Abie NNP 's POS Irish NNP Rose NNP '' '' made VBD the DT theme NN of IN courtship NN between IN the DT assimilated JJ offspring NN of IN Jewish JJ and CC Irish JJ immigrants NNS so RB popular JJ that IN its PRP$ author NN , , Anne NNP Nichols NNP , , lost VBD a DT plagiarism NN suit NN on IN the DT grounds NNS that IN the DT plot NN has VBZ entered VBN the DT public JJ domain NN . .
41 And CC it PRP has VBZ remained VBN there RB , , as IN evidenced VBN by IN its PRP$ reappearance NN in IN a DT 1972 CD CBS NNP sitcom NN called VBN `` `` Bridget NNP Loves VBZ Bernie NNP , , '' '' whose WP$ sole JJ distinction NN was VBD that IN it PRP led VBD to TO the DT real-life JJ marriage NN of IN Meredith NNP Baxter NNP and CC David NNP Birney NNP . .
26 Clearly RB , , the DT question NN with IN `` `` Chicken NNP Soup NNP '' '' is VBZ not RB whether IN the DT pot NN will MD boil NN over IN , , but CC whether IN it PRP will MD simmer VB at IN all DT . .
12 So RB far RB , , the DT bubbles NNS have VBP been VBN few JJ and CC far RB between IN . .
26 Part NN of IN the DT problem NN is VBZ the DT tendency NN of IN all DT sitcoms NNS , , ever RB since IN the DT didactic JJ days NNS of IN Norman NNP Lear NNP , , to TO preach VBP about IN social JJ issues NNS . .
21 To TO some DT extent NN , , this DT tendency NN emerges VBZ whenever WRB the DT show NN tries VBZ to TO enlighten VB us PRP about IN ethnic JJ stereotypes NNS by IN reversing VBG them PRP . .
33 For IN instance NN , , Michael NNP dislikes NN Jackie NNP not RB because IN he PRP 's VBZ a DT shrewd JJ Jewish JJ businessman NN , , but CC because IN he PRP quits VBZ his PRP$ well-paying JJ job NN as IN a DT salesman NN in IN order NN to TO become VB a DT social JJ worker NN . .
16 Even RB more RBR problematic JJ is VBZ the DT incompatibility NN between IN sitcom NN preachiness NN and CC Mr. NNP Mason NNP 's POS comic JJ persona NN . .
46 The DT best JJS moments NNS in IN the DT show NN occur VBP at IN the DT beginning NN and CC the DT end NN -LRB- -LRB- and CC occasionally RB in IN the DT middle NN -RRB- -RRB- , , when WRB Mr. NNP Mason NNP slips VBZ into IN his PRP$ standup NN mode NN and CC starts VBZ meting VBG out RP that IN old-fashioned JJ Jewish JJ mischief NN to TO other JJ people NNS as RB well RB as IN to TO himself PRP . .
30 But CC too RB often RB , , these DT routines NNS lack VBP spark VB because IN this DT sitcom NN , , like IN all DT sitcoms NNS , , is VBZ timid JJ about IN confronting VBG Mr. NNP Mason NNP 's POS stock NN in IN trade NN - : ethnic JJ differences NNS . .
24 I PRP 'm VBP not RB suggesting VBG that IN the DT producers NNS start VBP putting VBG together RB episodes NNS about IN topics NNS like IN the DT Catholic-Jewish JJ dispute NN over IN the DT Carmelite NNP convent NN at IN Auschwitz NNP . .
26 That DT issue NN , , like IN racial JJ tensions NNS in IN New NNP York NNP City NNP , , will MD have VB to TO cool VB down RP , , not RB heat NN up RB , , before IN it PRP can MD simmer VB . .
36 But CC I PRP am VBP suggesting VBG that IN they PRP stop VBP requiring VBG Mr. NNP Mason NNP to TO interrupt VB his PRP$ classic JJ shtik NN with IN some DT line NN about IN `` `` caring VBG for IN other JJ people NNS '' '' that WDT would MD sound VB shmaltzy JJ on IN the DT lips NNS of IN Miss NNP America NNP . .

40 And CC a DT senior JJ aide NN to TO the DT House NNP Ways NNPS and CC Means NNP Committee NNP , , where WRB tax NN legislation NN originates VBZ , , said VBD there EX are VBP n't RB any DT `` `` plans NNS to TO produce VB another DT tax NN bill NN that WDT could MD carry VB a DT gains NNS tax NN cut NN this DT year NN . . '' ''
31 One CD obvious JJ place NN to TO attach VB a DT capital-gains NNS tax NN cut NN , , and CC perhaps RB other JJ popular JJ items NNS stripped VBD from IN the DT deficit-reduction NN bill NN , , is VBZ the DT legislation NN to TO raise VB the DT federal JJ borrowing NN limit NN . .
12 Such JJ legislation NN must MD be VB enacted VBN by IN the DT end NN of IN the DT month NN . .
15 The DT Senate NNP bill NN was VBD pared VBN back RB in IN an DT attempt NN to TO speed VB deficit-reduction NN through IN Congress NNP . .
26 Because IN the DT legislation NN has VBZ n't RB been VBN completed VBN , , President NNP Bush NNP has VBZ until IN midnight NN tonight NN to TO enact VB across-the-board JJ spending NN cuts NNS mandated VBN by IN the DT Gramm-Rudman NNP deficit-reduction NN law NN . .
20 Senators NNS hope VBP that IN the DT need NN to TO avoid VB those DT cuts NNS will MD pressure VB the DT House NNP to TO agree VB to TO the DT streamlined JJ bill NN . .
9 The DT House NNP appears VBZ reluctant JJ to TO join VB the DT senators NNS . .
22 A DT key NN is VBZ whether IN House NNP Republicans NNPS are VBP willing JJ to TO acquiesce VB to TO their PRP$ Senate NNP colleagues NNS ' POS decision NN to TO drop VB many JJ pet JJ provisions NNS . .
49 `` `` Although IN I PRP am VBP encouraged VBN by IN the DT Senate NNP action NN , , '' '' said VBD Chairman NNP Dan NNP Rostenkowski NNP -LRB- -LRB- D.

'' ''
13 Another DT big JJ question NN hovering VBG over IN the DT debate NN is VBZ what WP President NNP Bush NNP thinks VBZ . .
17 He PRP has VBZ been VBN resisting VBG a DT stripped-down JJ bill NN without IN a DT guaranteed JJ vote NN on IN his PRP$ capital-gains NNS tax NN cut NN . .
35 But CC Republican JJ senators NNS saw VBD no DT way NN to TO overcome VB a DT procedural JJ hurdle NN and CC garner VB the DT 60 CD votes NNS needed VBN to TO win VB the DT capital-gains NNS issue NN on IN the DT floor NN , , so IN they PRP went VBD ahead RB with IN the DT streamlined JJ bill NN . .
25 The DT Senate NNP bill NN was VBD stripped VBN of IN many JJ popular JJ , , though IN revenue-losing JJ , , provisions NNS , , a DT number NN of IN which WDT are VBP included VBN in IN the DT House-passed JJ bill NN . .
18 These DT include VBP a DT child-care JJ initiative NN and CC extensions NNS of IN soon-to-expire JJ tax NN breaks NNS for IN low-income JJ housing NN and CC research-and-development NN expenditures NNS . .
34 Also RB missing VBG from IN the DT Senate NNP bill NN is VBZ the DT House NNP 's POS repeal NN of IN a DT law NN , , called VBN Section NN 89 CD , , that WDT compels VBZ companies NNS to TO give VB rank-and-file JJ workers NNS comparable JJ health NN benefits NNS to TO top VB paid VBN executives NNS . .
44 One CD high-profile JJ provision NN that WDT was VBD originally RB in IN the DT Senate NNP bill NN but CC was VBD cut VBN out IN because IN it PRP lost VBD money NN was VBD the DT proposal NN by IN Chairman NNP Lloyd NNP Bentsen NNP -LRB- -LRB- D.

13 Mr. NNP Bentsen NNP said VBD he PRP hopes VBZ the DT Senate NNP will MD consider VB that DT measure NN soon RB . .
28 To TO the DT delight NN of IN some DT doctors NNS , , the DT bill NN dropped VBD a DT plan NN passed VBN by IN the DT Finance NNP Committee NNP that WDT would MD have VB overhauled VBN the DT entire JJ physician-reimbursement NN system NN under IN Medicare NNP . .
23 To TO the DT detriment NN of IN many JJ low-income JJ people NNS , , efforts NNS to TO boost VB Medicaid NNP funding NN , , especially RB in IN rural JJ areas NNS , , also RB were VBD stricken JJ . .
33 Asked VBN why WRB senators NNS were VBD giving VBG up RP so RB much RB , , New NNP Mexico NNP Sen. NNP Pete NNP Domenici NNP , , the DT ranking JJ Republican NNP on IN the DT Senate NNP Budget NNP Committee NNP , , said VBD , , `` `` We PRP 're VBP looking VBG like IN idiots NNS . .
8 Things NNS had VBD just RB gone VBN too RB far RB . . '' ''
12 Sen. NNP Dole NNP said VBD that IN the DT move NN required VBN sacrifice NN by IN every DT senator NN . .
18 It PRP worked VBD , , others NNS said VBD , , because IN there EX were VBD no DT exceptions NNS : : all DT revenue-losing JJ provisions NNS were VBD stricken JJ . .
28 The DT Senate NNP also RB dropped VBD a DT plan NN by IN its PRP$ Finance NNP Committee NNP that WDT would MD have VB increased VBN the DT income NN threshold NN beyond IN which WDT senior JJ citizens NNS have VBP their PRP$ Social NNP Security NNP benefits NNS reduced VBD . .
21 In IN addition NN , , the DT bill NN dropped VBD a DT plan NN to TO make VB permanent JJ a DT 3 CD % NN excise NN tax NN on IN long-distance JJ telephone NN calls NNS . .
31 It PRP no RB longer RB includes VBZ a DT plan NN that WDT would MD have VB repealed VBN what WP remains VBZ of IN the DT completed-contract JJ method NN of IN accounting NN , , which WDT is VBZ used VBN by IN military JJ contractors NNS to TO reduce VB their PRP$ tax NN burden NN . .
23 It PRP also RB drops VBZ a DT provision NN that WDT would MD have VB permitted VBN corporations NNS to TO use VB excess JJ pension NN funds NNS to TO pay VB health NN benefits NNS for IN current JJ retirees NNS . .
27 Also RB stricken VBN was VBD a DT fivefold RB increase NN in IN the DT maximum JJ Occupational NNP Safety NNP and CC Health NNP Administration NNP penalties NNS , , which WDT would MD have VB raised VBN $ $ 65 CD million CD in IN fiscal JJ 1990 CD . .
16 A DT provision NN that WDT would MD have VB made VBN the DT Social NNP Security NNP Administration NNP an DT independent JJ agency NN was VBD excised VBN . .
19 The DT approval NN of IN the DT Senate NNP bill NN was VBD especially RB sweet JJ for IN Sen. NNP Mitchell NNP , , who WP had VBD proposed VBN the DT streamlining NN . .
56 Mr. NNP Mitchell NNP 's POS relations NNS with IN Budget NNP Director NNP Darman NNP , , who WP pushed VBD for IN a DT capital-gains NNS cut NN to TO be VB added VBN to TO the DT measure NN , , have VBP been VBN strained VBN since IN Mr. NNP Darman NNP chose VBD to TO bypass VB the DT Maine NNP Democrat NNP and CC deal NN with IN other JJ lawmakers NNS earlier RBR this DT year NN during IN a DT dispute NN over IN drug NN funding NN in IN the DT fiscal JJ 1989 CD supplemental JJ spending NN bill NN . .

11 The DT revenue-raising JJ provisions NNS , , which WDT affect VBP mostly RB corporations NNS , , would MD : :

32 I PRP disagree VBP with IN the DT statement NN by IN Mr. NNP Lantos NNP that IN one CD should MD not RB draw VB an DT adverse JJ inference NN against IN former JJ HUD NNP officials NNS who WP assert VBP their PRP$ Fifth JJ Amendment NNP privilege NN against IN self-incrimination NN in IN congressional JJ hearings NNS . .
28 The DT Fifth NNP Amendment NNP states NNS in IN relevant JJ part NN that IN no DT person NN `` `` shall MD be VB compelled VBN , , in IN any DT criminal JJ case NN , , to TO be VB a DT witness NN against IN himself PRP . . '' ''
21 This DT privilege NN against IN self-incrimination NN precludes NNS the DT drawing NN of IN an DT adverse JJ inference NN against IN a DT criminal JJ defendant NN who WP chooses VBZ not RB to TO testify VB . .
43 Thus RB , , in IN a DT criminal JJ case NN , , a DT prosecutor NN can MD not RB comment VB on IN a DT defendant NN 's POS failure NN to TO testify VB nor CC can MD the DT defendant NN be VB compelled VBN to TO take VB the DT stand NN as IN a DT witness NN , , thus RB forcing VBG him PRP to TO `` `` take VB the DT Fifth NNP . . '' ''
23 The DT privilege NN , , however RB , , has VBZ been VBN limited VBN in IN accordance NN with IN its PRP$ plain JJ language NN to TO protect VB the DT defendant NN in IN criminal JJ matters NNS only RB . .
33 The DT Supreme NNP Court NNP and CC some DT states NNS have VBP specifically RB recognized VBN that IN `` `` the DT Fifth NNP Amendment NNP does VBZ not RB preclude VB the DT inference NN where WRB the DT privilege NN is VBZ claimed VBN by IN a DT party NN to TO a DT civil JJ cause NN . . '' ''
11 Baxter NNP v. CC Palmingiano NNP , , 425 CD U.S. NNP 308 JJ -LRB- -LRB- 1976 CD -RRB- -RRB- . .
48 Thus RB , , in IN a DT civil JJ case NN , , a DT defendant NN may MD be VB called VBN as IN a DT witness NN , , he PRP may MD be VB forced VBN to TO testify VB or CC take VB the DT Fifth NNP , , and CC his PRP$ taking VBG of IN the DT Fifth NNP may MD permit VB the DT drawing NN of IN an DT adverse JJ inference NN against IN him PRP in IN the DT civil JJ matter NN . .
29 He PRP may MD take VB the DT Fifth NNP in IN a DT civil JJ matter NN only RB if IN he PRP has VBZ a DT good JJ faith NN and CC justifiable JJ belief NN that IN his PRP$ testimony NN may MD subject VB him PRP to TO criminal JJ prosecution NN . .
53 Allowing VBG the DT defendant NN to TO take VB the DT Fifth NNP in IN a DT civil JJ matter NN is VBZ not RB based VBN on IN a DT constitutional JJ right NN to TO refuse VB to TO testify VB where WRB one CD 's POS testimony NN harms VBZ him PRP in IN the DT civil JJ matter NN , , but CC because IN the DT testimony NN in IN the DT civil JJ matter NN could MD be VB unconstitutionally RB used VBN against IN him PRP in IN a DT subsequent JJ criminal JJ prosecution NN . .
16 Absent VB the DT risk NN of IN such JJ prosecution NN , , a DT court NN may MD order VB the DT defendant NN to TO testify VB . .
48 Thus RB , , when WRB Mr. NNP Pierce NNP asserted VBD the DT Fifth NNP in IN a DT noncriminal JJ proceeding NN , , particularly RB after IN presumably RB receiving VBG extensive JJ advice NN from IN legal JJ counsel NN , , one CD must MD conclude VB that IN he PRP held VBD a DT good-faith NN , , justifiable JJ belief NN that IN his PRP$ testimony NN could MD be VB used VBN against IN him PRP in IN a DT subsequent JJ criminal JJ prosecution NN . .
36 The DT subcommittee NN , , Congress NNP and CC the DT American JJ public NN have VBP every DT right NN to TO draw VB the DT adverse JJ inference NN and CC to TO concur VB with IN Mr. NNP Pierce NNP 's POS own JJ belief NN that IN his PRP$ testimony NN could MD help VB convict VB him PRP of IN a DT crime NN . .

20 In IN academia NN , , a DT so-called JJ Friday NNP the DT 13th JJ effect NN has VBZ been VBN set VBN up RP and CC shot NN down IN by IN different JJ professors NNS . .

29 -- : By IN 11:59 CD p.m. NN tonight NN , , President NNP Bush NNP must MD order VB $ $ 16 CD billion CD of IN automatic JJ , , across-the-board JJ cuts NNS in IN government NN spending NN to TO comply VB with IN the DT Gramm-Rudman NNP budget NN law NN . .
19 The DT cuts NNS are VBP necessary JJ because IN Congress NNP and CC the DT administration NN have VBP failed VBN to TO reach VB agreement NN on IN a DT deficit-cutting JJ bill NN . .
44 `` `` We PRP simply RB do VBP n't RB have VB strong JJ leadership NN to TO try VB to TO reduce VB the DT deficit NN and CC make VB tough JJ choices NNS , , '' '' House NNP Budget NNP Committee NNP Chairman NNP Leon NNP Panetta NNP -LRB- -LRB- D.

26 -- : For IN the DT last JJ two CD weeks NNS , , the DT Bush NNP administration NN and CC the DT Federal NNP Reserve NNP have VBP been VBN engaged VBN in IN a DT semi-public JJ battle NN over IN international JJ economic JJ policy NN . .
17 The DT administration NN has VBZ been VBN trying VBG to TO push VB the DT dollar NN lower JJR ; : the DT Fed NNP has VBZ been VBN resisting VBG . .
45 `` `` One CD of IN the DT things NNS that WDT continues VBZ to TO worry VB me PRP is VBZ this DT monetary JJ warfare NN between IN the DT Treasury NNP Department NNP and CC the DT Federal NNP Reserve NNP Board NNP , , '' '' said VBD Lawrence NNP Kudlow NNP , , a DT Bear NNP , , Stearns NNP & CC Co. NNP economist NN , , on IN ABC NNP 's POS `` `` This DT Week NN . . '' ''
19 -- : The DT administration NN has VBZ sent VBN out RP confusing JJ signals NNS about IN its PRP$ response NN to TO a DT recent JJ spate NN of IN airline NN takeovers NNS . .
21 Last JJ month NN , , Transportation NNP Secretary NNP Sam NNP Skinner NNP forced VBD Northwest NNP Airlines NNPS to TO reduce VB a DT stake NN held VBN by IN KLM NNP Royal NNP Dutch NNP Airlines NNPS . .
18 But CC he PRP has VBZ since IN run VBN into IN opposition NN from IN the DT Treasury NNP and CC the DT White NNP House NNP over IN that DT decision NN . .
27 And CC he PRP has VBZ kept VBN mum NN on IN how WRB his PRP$ decision NN might MD affect VB a DT bid NN for IN United NNP Airlines NNPS , , which WDT includes VBZ a DT big JJ stake NN by IN British NNP Airways NNPS PLC NNP . .
30 Some DT analysts NNS say VBP uncertainty NN about IN Washington NNP 's POS anti-takeover JJ policy NN was VBD one CD reason NN that WDT financing NN for IN the DT United NNP Airlines NNPS takeover NN fell VBD through IN -- : the DT event NN that WDT triggered VBD the DT market NN drop NN . .
23 In IN many JJ ways NNS , , the DT backdrop NN to TO Friday NNP 's POS stock NN decline NN is VBZ eerily RB similar JJ to TO that DT of IN October NNP 1987 CD 's POS 508-point JJ crash NN . .
22 Then RB , , as IN now RB , , the DT budget NN debate NN was VBD behind IN schedule NN and CC automatic JJ spending NN cuts NNS were VBD within IN days NNS of IN taking VBG hold NN . .
28 The DT Treasury NNP was VBD locked VBN in IN a DT battle NN over IN international JJ economic JJ policy NN , , although IN at IN that WDT time NN it PRP was VBD with IN West JJ German JJ officials NNS rather RB than IN the DT Federal NNP Reserve NNP . .
29 And CC concern NN about IN official JJ actions NNS aimed VBN at IN takeovers NNS -- : then RB by IN the DT tax-writing JJ House NNP Ways NNPS and CC Means NNPS Committee NNP rather RB than IN the DT Transportation NNP Department NNP -- : were VBD making VBG markets NNS nervous JJ . .
50 The DT 1987 CD crash NN brought VBD the DT Reagan NNP administration NN and CC Democratic JJ lawmakers NNS to TO the DT table NN for IN the DT first JJ budget NN summit NN , , resulting VBG in IN a DT two-year JJ plan NN to TO reduce VB the DT deficit NN by IN more JJR than IN $ $ 76 CD billion CD -- : even RB though IN the DT deficit NN actually RB rose VBD by IN nearly RB $ $ 12 CD billion CD during IN that DT period NN . .
21 But CC , , barring VBG further JJ drops NNS in IN the DT market NN this DT week NN , , a DT similar JJ outcome NN does VBZ n't RB seem VB likely JJ this DT year NN . .
53 Lawmakers NNS and CC administration NN officials NNS agree VBP that IN Friday NNP 's POS drop NN , , by IN itself PRP , , is VBZ n't RB enough JJ to TO force VB both DT sides NNS back RB to TO the DT table NN to TO try VB to TO reach VB a DT deficit-reduction NN agreement NN that WDT would MD be VB more RBR serious JJ and CC more RBR far-reaching JJ than IN last JJ spring NN 's POS gimmick-ridden JJ plan NN , , which WDT still RB is VBZ n't RB fully RB implemented VBN . .
35 One CD of IN the DT biggest JJS reasons NNS that IN new JJ talks NNS are VBP n't RB likely JJ to TO come VB about RB is VBZ that DT , , as IN everyone NN learned VBD in IN 1987 CD , , the DT economy NN and CC the DT market NN can MD survive VB a DT one-day JJ 508-point JJ tumble NN . .
29 `` `` Everybody NN thought VBD we PRP were VBD looking VBG at IN a DT repetition NN of IN 1929 CD , , that IN we PRP were VBD looking VBG at IN a DT recession NN , , '' '' Rep. NNP Panetta NNP said VBD yesterday NN in IN an DT interview NN . .
6 `` `` That DT did VBD not RB happen VB . .
11 They PRP learned VBD they PRP could MD survive VB it PRP without IN much JJ problem NN . . '' ''
36 But CC administration NN officials NNS privately RB agree VBP with IN Mr. NNP Panetta NNP , , who WP said VBD a DT precipitous JJ drop NN this DT week NN `` `` is VBZ going VBG to TO force VB the DT president NN and CC Congress NNP to TO take VB a DT much JJ harder JJR look NN at IN fiscal JJ policy NN . . '' ''
14 In IN that DT case NN , , there EX will MD be VB plenty NN of IN blame NN to TO go VB around RP . .
61 `` `` There EX is VBZ an DT underlying VBG concern NN on IN the DT part NN of IN the DT American JJ people NNS -- : and CC there EX should MD be VB - : that IN the DT administration NN has VBZ not RB gone VBN far RB enough RB in IN cutting VBG this DT deficit NN and CC that IN Congress NNP has VBZ been VBN unwilling JJ to TO cut VB what WP the DT administration NN asked VBD us PRP to TO cut VB , , '' '' said VBD Senate NNP Finance NNP Committee NNP Chairman NNP Lloyd NNP Bentsen NNP -LRB- -LRB- D.

34 Nevertheless RB , , it PRP clearly RB will MD take VB more JJR than IN Friday NNP 's POS 190-point JJ decline NN to TO overcome VB the DT bitter JJ feelings NNS that WDT have VBP developed VBN between IN lawmakers NNS and CC White NNP House NNP Budget NNP Director NNP Richard NNP Darman NNP over IN the DT capital-gains NNS fight NN . .
32 Hill NNP Democrats NNPS are VBP particularly RB angry JJ over IN Mr. NNP Bush NNP 's POS claim NN that IN the DT capital-gains NNS cut NN was VBD part NN of IN April NNP 's POS budget NN accord NN and CC his PRP$ insistence NN on IN combining VBG it PRP with IN the DT deficit-reduction JJ legislation NN . .
51 `` `` There EX is VBZ no DT prospect NN of IN any DT so-called JJ grand JJ compromise NN or CC deal NN next JJ year NN because IN the DT administration NN simply RB did VBD n't RB live VB up RB to TO this DT year NN 's POS deal NN , , '' '' Senate NNP Majority NNP Leader NNP George NNP Mitchell NNP -LRB- -LRB- D.

27 During IN last JJ week NN 's POS maneuverings NNS on IN the DT deficit-cutting JJ bill NN and CC the DT capital-gains NNS issue NN , , there EX were VBD signs NNS that IN Senate NNP Republicans NNPS and CC the DT administration NN were VBD at IN odds NNS . .
38 At IN the DT very JJ moment NN that IN Senate NNP Republicans NNPS were VBD negotiating VBG a DT deal NN to TO exclude VB capital NN gains NNS from IN the DT deficit-reduction NN legislation NN , , White NNP House NNP spokesman NN Marlin NNP Fitzwater NNP told VBD reporters NNS that IN it PRP was VBD the DT president NN 's POS policy NN to TO include VB it PRP . .
32 When WRB an DT agreement NN was VBD reached VBN to TO strip VB capital NN gains NNS from IN the DT legislation NN , , Oregon NNP Sen. NNP Bob NNP Packwood NNP , , the DT ranking JJ GOP NNP member NN of IN the DT tax-writing JJ Senate NNP Finance NNP Committee NNP , , hailed VBD it PRP . .
21 Asked VBN if IN the DT administration NN agreed VBD , , he PRP curtly RB replied VBD : : `` `` The DT adminstration NN will MD have VB to TO speak VB for IN itself PRP . . '' ''
33 Friday NNP 's POS market NN tumble NN could MD spur VB action NN on IN reconciling VBG the DT House NNP and CC Senate NNP versions NNS of IN the DT deficit-reduction NN measure NN , , a DT process NN that WDT is VBZ n't RB expected VBN to TO begin VB until IN tomorrow NN at IN the DT soonest JJS . .
39 Senate NNP Republicans NNPS expressed VBD the DT hope NN that IN the DT House NNP would MD follow VB the DT lead NN of IN the DT Senate NNP , , which WDT on IN Friday NNP agreed VBD to TO drop VB a DT variety NN of IN spending NN measures NNS and CC tax NN breaks NNS that WDT would MD have VB increased VBN the DT fiscal JJ 1990 CD deficit NN . .
50 `` `` The DT market NN needs VBZ a DT strong JJ signal NN that IN we PRP 're VBP serious JJ about IN deficit NN reduction NN , , and CC the DT best JJS way NN to TO do VB that DT is VBZ for IN the DT House NNP of IN Representatives NNPS to TO strip VB their PRP$ bill NN '' '' of IN similar JJ provisions NNS , , Sen.

50 The DT White NNP House NNP Office NNP of IN Management NNP and CC Budget NNP , , whose WP$ calculations NNS determine VBP whether IN the DT Gramm-Rudman NNP targets NNS are VBP met VBN , , estimated VBD that IN the DT House-passed JJ deficit-reduction NN measure NN would MD cut VB the DT fiscal JJ 1990 CD shortfall NN by IN $ $ 6.2 CD billion CD , , almost RB half NN of IN the DT Congressional NNP Budget NNP Office NNP 's POS estimate NN of IN $ $ 11.0 CD billion CD . .
32 Rep. NNP Panetta NNP said VBD that IN OMB NNP 's POS figure NN would MD still RB be VB enough RB to TO avoid VB permanent JJ across-the-board JJ cuts NNS , , but CC added VBD : : `` `` We PRP 're VBP getting VBG very RB close JJ to TO the DT margins NNS here RB . . '' ''
20 No DT one CD in IN Washington NNP was VBD willing JJ to TO take VB the DT blame NN for IN provoking VBG Friday NNP 's POS drop NN in IN the DT stock NN market NN . .
10 But CC some DT players NNS were VBD quick JJ to TO seize VB the DT moment NN . .
42 Before IN the DT sun NN had VBD set VBN on IN Friday NNP , , Richard NNP Rahn NNP , , the DT supply-side JJ chief JJ economist NN of IN the DT U.S. NNP Chamber NNP of IN Commerce NNP , , issued VBD a DT statement NN attributing VBG the DT drop NN in IN stock NN prices NNS to TO the DT Senate NNP decision NN to TO postpone VB action NN on IN capital NN gains NNS . .

16 Compaq NNP 's POS series NN of IN notebooks NNS extends VBZ a DT trend NN toward IN downsizing VBG in IN the DT personal JJ computer NN market NN . .
23 One CD manufacturer NN already RB has VBZ produced VBN a DT clipboard-sized JJ computer NN called VBN a DT notepad NN , , and CC two CD others NNS have VBP introduced VBN even RB smaller JJR `` `` palmtops NNS . . '' ''
20 But CC those DT machines NNS are VBP still RB considered VBN novelties NNS , , with IN keyboards NNS only RB a DT munchkin NN could MD love VB and CC screens NNS to TO match VB . .

19 All DT of IN this DT comes VBZ in IN a DT machine NN that IN weighs VBZ only RB six CD pounds NNS and CC fits VBZ comfortably RB into IN most JJS briefcases NNS . .

19 Some DT critics NNS , , however RB , , say VBP its PRP$ ability NN to TO run VB commonplace NN programs NNS is VBZ restricted VBN by IN a DT limited JJ memory NN . .
31 Poquet NNP Computer NNP Corp. NNP , , meanwhile RB , , has VBZ introduced VBN a DT much RB more RBR sophisticated JJ palmtop NN that WDT can MD run VB Lotus NNP 1-2-3 NNP and CC other JJ sophisticated JJ software NN programs NNS , , but CC costs VBZ five CD times NNS as IN much JJ . .
45 At IN stake NN is VBZ what WP Mike NNP Swavely NNP , , Compaq NNP 's POS president NN of IN North NNP America NNP operations NNS , , calls VBZ `` `` the DT Holy NNP Grail NNP of IN the DT computer NN industry NN '' '' -- : the DT search NN for IN `` `` a DT real JJ computer NN in IN a DT package NN so RB small JJ you PRP can MD take VB it PRP everywhere RB . .

10 Size NN and CC weight NN considerations NNS also RB have VBP limited VBN screen NN displays NNS . .
10 The DT competitive JJ sniping NN can MD get VB pretty RB petty JJ at IN times NNS . .
23 A DT Poquet NNP spokesman NN , , for IN example NN , , criticizes VBZ the DT Atari NNP Portfolio NNP because IN it PRP requires VBZ three CD batteries NNS while IN the DT Poquet NNP needs VBZ only RB two CD . .
33 Both DT palmtops NNS are VBP dismissed VBN by IN notebook NN makers NNS , , who WP argue VBP that IN they PRP 're VBP too RB small JJ -- : a DT problem NN Poquet NNP also RB encountered VBD in IN focus NN groups NNS , , admits VBZ Gerry NNP Purdy NNP , , director NN of IN marketing NN . .

25 That DT 's VBZ because IN their PRP$ brokers NNS can MD require VB them PRP to TO sell VB some DT shares NNS or CC put VB up RB more JJR cash NN to TO enhance VB the DT collateral NN backing VBG their PRP$ loans NNS . .

20 The DT company NN 's POS U.S. NNP performance NN was VBD helped VBN by IN `` `` a DT record NN quarter NN for IN new JJ customers NNS , , '' '' he PRP said VBD . .
28 Tandem NNP makes VBZ `` `` fault-tolerant JJ '' '' computers NNS -- : machines NNS with IN built-in JJ backup NN systems NNS -- : that WDT run VBP stock NN exchanges NNS , , networks NNS of IN automatic JJ tellers NNS and CC other JJ complex JJ computer NN systems NNS . .
30 Tomorrow NN the DT company NN is VBZ scheduled VBN to TO announce VB its PRP$ most RBS powerful JJ computer NN ever RB , , which WDT for IN the DT first JJ time NN will MD bring VB it PRP into IN direct JJ competition NN with IN makers NNS of IN mainframe NN computers NNS . .

21 Prices NNS for IN the DT machine NN , , which WDT can MD come VB in IN various JJ configurations NNS , , are VBP $ $ 2 CD million CD to TO $ $ 10 CD million CD . .
22 Analysts NNS expect VBP the DT new JJ computer NN to TO wrest VB a DT hefty JJ slice NN of IN business NN away RB from IN IBM NNP , , the DT longtime JJ leader NN in IN mainframes NNS . .
32 `` `` We PRP believe VBP they PRP could MD siphon VB perhaps RB two CD to TO three CD billion CD dollars NNS from IN IBM NNP '' '' over IN the DT next JJ few JJ years NNS , , said VBD George NNP Weiss NNP , , an DT analyst NN at IN the DT Gartner NNP group NN . .
7 That DT will MD spur VB Tandem NNP 's POS growth NN . .
31 `` `` I PRP 'd MD be VB disappointed VBN if IN the DT company NN grew VBD by IN less JJR than IN 20 CD % NN next JJ year NN , , '' '' said VBD John NNP Levinson NNP , , an DT analyst NN at IN Goldman NNP , , Sachs NNP & CC Co NNP . .
31 IBM NNP is VBZ expected VBN to TO respond VB to TO Tandem NNP 's POS Cyclone NNP by IN discounting VBG its PRP$ own JJ mainframes NNS , , which WDT analysts NNS say VBP are VBP roughly RB three CD times NNS the DT price NN of IN a DT comparable JJ system NN from IN Tandem NNP . .
16 `` `` Obviously RB IBM NNP can MD give VB bigger JJR discounts NNS to TO users NNS immediately RB , , '' '' said VBD Mr. NNP Weiss NNP . .
33 But CC Mr. NNP Treybig NNP questions VBZ whether IN that DT will MD be VB enough RB to TO stop VB Tandem NNP 's POS first JJ mainframe NN from IN taking VBG on IN some DT of IN the DT functions NNS that WDT large JJ organizations NNS previously RB sought VBD from IN Big NNP Blue NNP 's POS machines NNS . .
16 `` `` The DT answer NN is VBZ n't RB price NN reductions NNS , , but CC new JJ systems NNS , , '' '' he PRP said VBD . .
27 Nevertheless RB , , Tandem NNP faces VBZ a DT variety NN of IN challenges NNS , , the DT biggest JJS being VBG that IN customers NNS generally RB view VBP the DT company NN 's POS computers NNS as IN complementary JJ to TO IBM NNP 's POS mainframes NNS . .
24 Even RB Mr. NNP Treybig NNP is VBZ reluctant JJ to TO abandon VB this DT notion NN , , insisting VBG that IN Tandem NNP 's POS new JJ machines NNS are VBP n't RB replacements NNS for IN IBM NNP 's POS mainframes NNS . .
13 `` `` We PRP 're VBP after IN a DT little JJ bigger JJR niche NN , , '' '' he PRP said VBD . .
5 Do VBP n't RB jump VB yet RB . .
16 The DT stock NN market NN 's POS swoon NN may MD turn VB out RP to TO be VB good JJ news NN for IN the DT economy NN . .
27 In IN one CD wild JJ hour NN of IN trading NN , , the DT market NN managed VBD to TO accomplish VB what WP the DT Bush NNP administration NN has VBZ been VBN trying VBG to TO do VB , , unsuccessfully RB , , for IN weeks NNS . .
24 It PRP is VBZ forcing VBG the DT Federal NNP Reserve NNP to TO ease VB its PRP$ grip NN on IN credit NN and CC it PRP took VBD the DT wind NN out IN of IN a DT previously RB irrepressible JJ dollar NN . .
23 The DT resulting VBG decline NN in IN interest NN rates NNS and CC the DT value NN of IN the DT dollar NN could MD reinvigorate VB American JJ business NN -- : indeed RB , , the DT entire JJ economy NN . .
6 This DT may MD sound VB strangely RB optimistic JJ . .
22 After IN all DT , , until IN a DT few JJ years NNS ago RB , , the DT stock NN market NN was VBD viewed VBN as IN a DT barometer NN of IN the DT national JJ economy NN . .
13 When WRB it PRP went VBD down RB , , by IN all DT tradition NN , , the DT economy NN followed VBD . .
21 That DT has VBZ changed VBN , , partly RB because IN the DT two CD years NNS following VBG the DT worst JJS stock-market NN plunge NN in IN history NN have VBP been VBN reasonably RB comfortable JJ . .
22 The DT 1987 CD crash NN was VBD `` `` a DT false JJ alarm NN however RB you PRP view VBP it PRP , , '' '' says VBZ University NNP of IN Chicago NNP economist NN Victor NNP Zarnowitz NNP . .
12 The DT market NN seems VBZ increasingly RB disconnected VBN from IN the DT rest NN of IN the DT nation NN . .
23 Its PRP$ spasms NNS ca MD n't RB be VB traced VBN to TO fundamental JJ business NN conditions NNS , , nor CC do VBP they PRP appear VBP to TO presage VB major JJ shifts NNS in IN the DT economy NN . .
25 `` `` The DT market NN today NN has VBZ a DT life NN of IN its PRP$ own JJ , , '' '' John NNP Akers NNP , , chairman NN of IN International NNP Business NNP Machines NNPS Corp. NNP , , said VBD Saturday NNP . .
12 `` `` There EX 's VBZ nothing NN rational JJ about IN this DT kind NN of IN action NN . . '' ''
20 Of IN course NN , , the DT health NN of IN the DT economy NN will MD be VB threatened VBN if IN the DT market NN continues VBZ to TO dive NN this DT week NN . .
27 Sharply NNP falling VBG stock NN prices NNS do VBP reduce VB consumer NN wealth NN , , damage NN business NN confidence NN and CC discourage VB the DT foreign JJ investors NNS upon IN whom WP the DT U.S. NNP now RB relies VBZ for IN financial JJ sustenance NN . .
10 The DT financial-services NNS industry NN was VBD battered VBN by IN the DT 1987 CD crash NN . .
24 What WP 's VBZ more JJR , , although IN the DT stock NN market NN is VBZ far RB less CC overvalued VBD today NN than IN two CD years NNS ago RB , , the DT U.S. NNP economy NN is VBZ weaker JJR . .
4 Growth NN is VBZ slower JJR . .
4 Profits NNS are VBP softer JJR . .
5 Debt NNP burdens NNS are VBP heavier JJR . .
26 But CC if IN the DT stock NN market NN does VBZ n't RB continue VB to TO plummet VB , , the DT beneficial JJ effects NNS of IN lower JJR interest NN rates NNS and CC a DT lower JJR dollar NN may MD well RB dominate VB . .
30 The DT Fed NNP , , which WDT until IN Friday NNP had VBD been VBN resisting VBG moves NNS to TO ease VB credit NN , , is VBZ now RB poised VBN to TO pour VB money NN into IN the DT economy NN if IN needed VBN to TO soothe VB the DT markets NNS . .
18 Fed NNP officials NNS may MD protest VB that IN this DT does VBZ n't RB necessarily RB mean VB a DT fundamental JJ change NN in IN their PRP$ interest-rate NN policies NNS . .
25 But CC the DT experience NN of IN the DT 1987 CD crash NN suggests VBZ the DT Fed NNP is VBZ likely JJ to TO bring VB down RP short-term JJ interest NN rates NNS in IN its PRP$ effort NN to TO calm JJ markets NNS . .
33 Anticipating VBG the DT Fed NNP 's POS move NN , , money NN traders NNS lowered VBD a DT key JJ interest NN rate NN known VBN as IN the DT Federal NNP Funds NNPS rate NN to TO 8.625 CD % NN late JJ Friday NNP , , down RB from IN 8.820 CD % NN the DT day NN before IN . .
33 Tiny NNP movements NNS in IN the DT rate NN , , which WDT is VBZ what WP banks NNS charge VBP each DT other JJ for IN overnight JJ loans NNS , , are VBP usually RB among IN the DT few JJ visible JJ tracks NNS that IN the DT Fed NNP leaves VBZ on IN the DT monetary JJ markets NNS . .
26 The DT dollar NN also RB began VBD to TO decline VB Friday NNP as IN the DT stock NN market NN 's POS plunge NN caused VBD some DT investors NNS to TO reassess NN their PRP$ desire NN to TO invest VB in IN the DT U.S. NNP . .
34 Treasury NNP officials NNS have VBP been VBN arguing VBG for IN months NNS that IN the DT dollar NN 's POS strength NN was VBD out RB of IN whack VB with IN economic JJ fundamentals NNS , , threatening VBG to TO extinguish VB the DT export NN boom NN that WDT has VBZ sustained VBN manufacturers NNS for IN several JJ years NNS . .
19 The DT market NN drop NN has VBZ now RB apparently RB convinced VBN foreign JJ investors NNS that IN the DT Treasury NNP was VBD right RB about IN the DT overpriced JJ dollar NN . .
22 A DT modest JJ drop NN in IN the DT dollar NN -- : only RB a DT modest JJ one CD , , mind NN you PRP -- : would MD be VB welcomed VBN by IN the DT U.S. NNP . .
43 That DT was VBD n't RB the DT case NN in IN 1987 CD , , when WRB the DT dollar NN was VBD so RB weak JJ that IN some DT economists NNS and CC government NN officials NNS seriously RB worried VBD that IN it PRP might MD collapse VB , , producing VBG panic NN among IN foreign JJ investors NNS and CC diminishing VBG the DT flow NN of IN foreign JJ capital NN to TO the DT U.S. NNP . .
12 Another DT big JJ difference NN between IN 1987 CD and CC 1989 CD is VBZ n't RB so RB comforting JJ . .
19 In IN the DT third JJ quarter NN of IN 1987 CD , , the DT economy NN spurted VBN at IN an DT inflation-adjusted JJ annual JJ rate NN of IN 5.3 CD % NN . .
27 The DT consensus NN among IN economists NNS is VBZ that IN it PRP grew VBD a DT much RB more RBR sluggish JJ 2.3 CD % NN in IN the DT third JJ quarter NN of IN 1989 CD , , which WDT ended VBD two CD weeks NNS ago RB . .
37 The DT plunge NN in IN stock NN prices NNS `` `` is VBZ happening VBG at IN a DT time NN when WRB the DT economy NN has VBZ already RB slowed VBN down RP , , '' '' says VBZ economist NN Lawrence NNP Chimerine NNP of IN WEFA NNP Group NNP , , a DT Bala NNP Cynwyd NNP , , Pa.

10 `` `` A DT lot NN of IN pent-up JJ demand NN is VBZ gone VBN . . '' ''
36 Consumer NN spending NN did VBD drop VB in IN the DT months NNS following VBG Black NNP Monday NNP 1987 CD -- : `` `` but CC only RB slightly RB and CC for IN a DT short JJ period NN of IN time NN , , '' '' recalls VBZ Mr. NNP Zarnowitz NNP , , a DT longtime JJ student NN of IN business NN cycles NNS . .
8 `` `` That DT was VBD offset VBN by IN strength NN elsewhere RB . .
18 -LCB- DT The DT effects NNS -RCB- NNP were VBD much RB less JJR severe JJ and CC less JJR prolonged JJ than IN some DT had VBD feared VBN or CC expected VBN . .
32 '' '' Today NN , , he PRP frets VBZ , , exports NNS and CC business NN investment NN spending NN may MD be VB insufficient JJ to TO pick VB up RP the DT slack NN if IN stock NN prices NNS sink NN this DT week NN and CC if IN consumers NNS retrench VBP in IN reaction NN . .
17 What WP 's VBZ more JJR , , the DT corporate JJ borrowing NN binge NN has VBZ n't RB abated VBD in IN the DT past JJ two CD years NNS . .
28 `` `` We PRP 've VBP had VBD two CD more JJR years NNS of IN significant JJ accumulation NN of IN debt NN ... : just RB at IN the DT time NN when WRB earnings NNS are VBP being VBG squeezed VBN , , '' '' Mr. NNP Chimerine NNP notes VBZ . .
18 The DT more JJR a DT company NN relies VBZ on IN borrowed VBN money NN , , the DT greater JJR its PRP$ sensitivity NN to TO an DT economic JJ slowdown NN . .
24 A DT company NN with IN a DT strong JJ balance NN sheet NN can MD withstand VB an DT unanticipated JJ storm NN ; : a DT highly RB leveraged JJ company NN may MD end VB up RP in IN bankruptcy NN court NN . .
23 The DT Fed NNP , , of IN course NN , , knows VBZ that DT very RB well RB -- : hence RB its PRP$ readiness NN to TO pump VB credit NN into IN the DT economy NN this DT morning NN . .
12 But CC , , in IN the DT process NN , , the DT Fed NNP risks NNS reigniting VBG inflation NN . .
46 Even RB before IN Friday NNP 's POS events NNS , , Harvard NNP University NNP economist NN Benjamin NNP Friedman NNP was VBD arguing VBG that IN the DT Fed NNP wo MD n't RB be VB able JJ to TO live VB up RB to TO its PRP$ tough JJ words NNS on IN eliminating VBG inflation NN because IN of IN its PRP$ responsibility NN to TO protect VB fragile JJ financial JJ markets NNS , , banks NNS and CC highly RB leveraged JJ corporations NNS . .
24 The DT biggest JJS threat NN on IN the DT economic JJ horizon NN right RB now RB is VBZ n't RB recession NN , , he PRP reasons VBZ ; : it PRP 's VBZ an DT outbreak NN of IN uncontrolled JJ inflation NN . .
20 In IN the DT end NN , , the DT 1987 CD collapse NN suggested VBD , , the DT economy NN does VBZ n't RB move VB in IN lockstep NN with IN stock NN prices NNS . .
18 The DT economy NN does VBZ , , however RB , , depend VBP on IN the DT confidence NN of IN businesses NNS , , consumers NNS and CC foreign JJ investors NNS . .
11 A DT panic NN on IN Wall NNP Street NNP does VBZ n't RB exactly RB inspire VB confidence NN . .
10 Surveys NNS suggested VBD that IN consumer NN confidence NN was VBD high JJ before IN Friday NNP . .
26 A DT 190-point JJ drop NN is VBZ n't RB likely JJ to TO make VB much JJ of IN a DT dent NN ; : multiply VB that DT a DT few JJ times NNS over RB , , though IN , , and CC it PRP will MD . .
32 If IN the DT reactions NNS of IN executives NNS gathered VBD Saturday NNP at IN Hot NNP Springs NNP , , Va. NNP , , for IN the DT Business NNP Council NNP meetings NNS are VBP typical JJ , , business NN leaders NNS were VBD n't RB overly RB rattled VBN by IN Friday NNP 's POS decline NN . .
25 And CC if IN foreign JJ investors NNS become VBP a DT tad NN more RBR cautious JJ -- : well RB , , the DT dollar NN 's POS recent JJ strength NN suggests VBZ that IN the DT U.S. NNP can MD stand VB it PRP . .
22 On IN the DT bottom JJ line NN , , the DT most RBS comforting JJ fact NN for IN the DT economic JJ outlook NN is VBZ that IN we PRP 've VBP been VBN through IN this DT before RB . .
19 Two CD years NNS ago RB , , about IN the DT only JJ point NN of IN comparison NN was VBD the DT 1929 CD crash NN and CC the DT subsequent JJ Depression NNP . .
7 The DT doomsayers NNS had VBD a DT receptive JJ audience NN . .
13 The DT prosperity NN that WDT followed VBD Black NNP Monday NNP permits VBZ a DT more RBR optimistic JJ view NN today NN . .
22 At IN the DT very RB least JJS , , the DT establishment NN here RB is VBZ taking VBG comfort NN from IN the DT nation NN 's POS success NN in IN handling VBG the DT last JJ go-around NN . .

7 They PRP are VBP more RBR sophisticated JJ this DT time NN . .
26 The DT chemical NN industry NN is VBZ expected VBN to TO report VB that IN profits NNS eroded VBN in IN the DT third JJ quarter NN because IN of IN skidding NN prices NNS in IN the DT commodity NN end NN of IN the DT business NN . .
24 Producers NNS of IN commodity NN chemicals NNS , , the DT basic JJ chemicals NNS produced VBN in IN huge JJ volumes NNS for IN other JJ manufacturers NNS , , have VBP seen VBN sharp JJ inventory NN cutting VBG by IN buyers NNS . .

42 Perhaps RB most RBS prominent JJ , , Dow NNP Chemical NNP Co.

9 Most JJS of IN the DT 10 CD have VBP big JJ commodity-chemical JJ operations NNS . .
