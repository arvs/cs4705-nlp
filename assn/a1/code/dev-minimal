TAKE
OVER
AT

AFTER
INNINGS
VICTORY

LONDON
1996-08-30

West
Indian
all-rounder
Phil
Simmons
took
four
for
38
on
Friday
as
Leicestershire
beat
Somerset
by
an
innings
and
39
runs
in
two
days
to
take
over
at
the
head
of
the
county
championship
.

Their
stay
on
top
,
though
,
may
be
short-lived
as
title
rivals
Essex
,
Derbyshire
and
Surrey
all
closed
in
on
victory
while
Kent
made
up
for
lost
time
in
their
rain-affected
match
against
Nottinghamshire
.

After
bowling
Somerset
out
for
83
on
the
opening
morning
at
Grace
Road
,
Leicestershire
extended
their
first
innings
by
94
runs
before
being
bowled
out
for
296
with
England
discard
Andy
Caddick
taking
three
for
83
.

Trailing
by
213
,
Somerset
got
a
solid
start
to
their
second
innings
before
Simmons
stepped
in
to
bundle
them
out
for
174
.

Essex
,
however
,
look
certain
to
regain
their
top
spot
after
Nasser
Hussain
and
Peter
Such
gave
them
a
firm
grip
on
their
match
against
Yorkshire
at
Headingley
.

Hussain
,
considered
surplus
to
England
's
one-day
requirements
,
struck
158
,
his
first
championship
century
of
the
season
,
as
Essex
reached
372
and
took
a
first
innings
lead
of
82
.

By
the
close
Yorkshire
had
turned
that
into
a
37-run
advantage
but
off-spinner
Such
had
scuttled
their
hopes
,
taking
four
for
24
in
48
balls
and
leaving
them
hanging
on
119
for
five
and
praying
for
rain
.
